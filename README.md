# InterText
A simple tool for creating and translating interlinear texts, using Python 3 and PyQt4.

## Getting started
A few tips before you get started.

### What you will need
You'll need to have Python 3 installed as well as PyQt4.

### New
Load a new .txt file with chapters separated by _DIV_ (including a _DIV_ at the top of the .txt file before the first chapter). If your .txt file has 10 chapters, there should be 10 _DIV_s.

### Open
Open an existing project. Saved projects should have the .ilt extension.

### Export
Export a project into the format required by the learn-to-read-foreign-languages.com interlinear text scripts.

## Notes
Currently the second row of text input boxes doesn't do anything (and isn't saved). Later it will be used for grammar explanations.
